Subject: Request for Change in DBMS Faculty.

Respected Sir,

Date : 

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to express my sincere concern regarding the current faculty teaching the Database Management System (DBMS) subject, {Ms.Meenakshi Wanode}, and I would like to request a change in the faculty for this particular course.

 While we appreciate the efforts of the current faculty, we have encountered challenges in grasping many  concepts due to the teaching methodology or communication style. DBMS is a foundational course for our academic path, and all the students strongly believe that a faculty change could greatly enhance the learning experience for us.

We are willing to collaborate and participate actively in any discussions or processes that may be required to facilitate this change. Your support and consideration in this matter would be greatly appreciated by all.

Thank you for taking the time to read our letter and considering our request. We look forward to any updates or feedback you may have regarding this matter.We have attached the signatures for all the agreeing students facing the same.

Yours Sincerely,

Students of Section J,
Bachelor of Technology(Computer Science),
Second Year.
